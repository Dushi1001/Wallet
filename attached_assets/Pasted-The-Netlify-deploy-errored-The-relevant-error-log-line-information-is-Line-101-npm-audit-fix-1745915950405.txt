Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
- The build failed with the error: 
  - `Could not resolve "./Sidebar" from "client/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx"` [#L113](#L113).
- Another error is related to an unsupported engine due to a Node version mismatch [#L121](#L121).

### Solution
1. **Resolve Module Resolution Error**:
   - The error `Could not resolve "./Sidebar" from "client/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx"` suggests that the file "./Sidebar" could not be found from "Layout.tsx".
   - Verify that the file "Sidebar.tsx" exists in the correct location and was committed to the repository.
   
2. **Fix Node Version Mismatch**:
   - The error `Unsupported engine - package: 'react-router@7.5.3', required: { node: '>=20.0.0' }, current: { node: 'v18.20.8', npm: '10.8.2'` indicates that the current Node version does not meet the required version.
   - Update the Node version to at least v20.0.0. For guidance on changing Node versions on Netlify, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).
