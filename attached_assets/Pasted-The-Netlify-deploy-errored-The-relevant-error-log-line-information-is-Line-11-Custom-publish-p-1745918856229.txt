Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to an npm error code `EJSONPARSE`. The error occurred while trying to parse the `package.json` file located in the `client` directory.

The relevant error lines in the build log are:
- Line 78: `npm error code EJSONPARSE`
- Line 79: `npm error path /opt/build/repo/client/package.json`
- Line 80: `npm error JSON.parse Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 9 while parsing near "\"scripts\": {\\n \"build\\"`
- Line 81: `npm error JSON.parse Failed to parse JSON data.`
- Line 82: `npm error JSON.parse Note: package.json must be actual JSON, not just JavaScript.`

### Solution
1. The error is caused by an issue in the JSON formatting of the `package.json` file in the `client` directory.
2. To resolve this issue, navigate to the `client` directory and correct the JSON formatting in the `package.json` file.
3. Verify that the `package.json` file is valid JSON and does not contain any syntax errors.
4. Once the `package.json` file is corrected, commit the changes to the repository and trigger a new build to ensure the issue is resolved.
