Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to the following errors:
1. Line 113: Could not resolve "./Sidebar" from "client/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx".
2. Lines 123-126: There are unsupported Node versions for the packages react-router and react-router-dom.
3. Lines 161-166: Could not resolve "pg-cloudflare" which is causing an error in the build.

### Solution
1. The error on line 113 indicates that the file "./Sidebar" referenced in "client/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx" could not be resolved. To fix this, verify that the file "./Sidebar" exists and is correctly spelled in the specified location.
   
2. The unsupported Node versions error for the packages react-router and react-router-dom can be addressed by updating the Node.js version to meet the requirements specified (`node: '>=20.0.0'`). Refer to the documentation for [changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).

3. To resolve the error related to "pg-cloudflare", mark the path "pg-cloudflare" as external to exclude it from the bundle. Make sure the package "pg-cloudflare" is in your package.json or was committed to the repository. Update the build configuration to handle external dependencies appropriately.
