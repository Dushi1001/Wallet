Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message:
```
Could not resolve entry module "index.html".
```

**Solution:**
1. The error indicates that the build could not find the entry module "index.html." This could be due to misconfiguration or missing files within the project.
2. Ensure that the entry file "index.html" exists in the specified location and is correctly referenced in the build configuration.
3. Verify that the file was committed to the repository and that its path matches the configuration used in the build process. 
4. Update the build configuration to correctly point to the existing "index.html" file for the build process to resolve the entry module correctly.
